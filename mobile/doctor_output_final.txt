??? Check that required peer dependencies are installed
Missing peer dependency: expo-font
Required by: @expo/vector-icons
Advice:
Install missing required peer dependency with "npx expo install expo-font"
Your app may crash outside of Expo Go without this dependency. Native module peer dependencies must be installed directly.
